- Put orignal WSJ0 dataset under this directory, symlink is also OK. So the dataset is `app/datasets/WSJ0/WSJ0`
  The dataset can either have orignal 15-CD structure, or have merge directories. Otherwise the directory structure
  shouldn't be changed.
  The orignal dataset has a paid license, so we can't put it here.

- If you can't access Internet, then you should put `sph2pipe` program in this directory
  With internet access, the install script will automatically download and compile it.

- run install.sh, when completed, you can set `DATASET_TYPE='wsj0'` in `app/hparams.py`
