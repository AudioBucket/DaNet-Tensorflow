WSJ0 dataset

**WARNING** If you change `FFT_SIZE`, `FFT_STRIDE`, `FFT_WND` or `SMP_RATE`
in your setup, you should also change them in `process.py`, then redo the preprocessing


- You need h5py and fuel

    h5py is available via pip: `pip install h5py`

    or conda: `conda install h5py`

    fuel is available at https://github.com/mila-udem/fuel

- Put original WSJ0 dataset under this directory, symlink is also OK. So the dataset is `app/datasets/WSJ0/WSJ0`
  The dataset can have either the original 15-CD structure, or merged directories. However the directory structure
  shouldn't be changed elsewhere.
  The original dataset has a paid license, so we can't put it here.

- [Optional] If you can't access Internet, then you should put `sph2pipe` program under this directory
  With internet access, the install script will automatically download and compile it.

- Run `install.sh`, when completed, you can set `DATASET_TYPE` to `"wsj0"` in JSON config file

- [Optional] If you would like to put the processed dataset elsewhere for storage reasons,
  you can do `./install.sh /path/to/wsj0-danet.hdf5`.
  Then, under this directory make symlink via `ln -s /path/to/wsj0-danet.hdf5 wsj0-danet.hdf5`.
